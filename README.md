# Time-Based-Discounts
This project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the Year class from the JFreeChart library. It verifies constructors, navigation (previous() and next()), parsing, comparison, equality, and millisecond calculations, with special focus on edge cases across the full valid range (-9999 to 9999).

Additionally, the project features a Java-based discount management system that calculates product prices based on seasonal discounts. It handles both regular and promotional weeks using a modular design with DiscountManager and the IDiscountCalculator interface. The codebase is clean and testable, supported by JUnit and JMock tests to ensure reliability and encourage test-driven development.
