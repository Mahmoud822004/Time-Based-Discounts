# Time-Based-Discounts
This project includes unit tests for JFreeChart's Year class and a Java-based discount system that adjusts prices based on seasonal rules. It uses clean, modular code with JUnit and JMock to ensure correctness, covering edge cases, special weeks, and promoting test-driven development.
